# 429 Rate Limit Error Fix

## 🚨 Problem Identified

Your Render deployment was giving **429 "Too Many Requests"** errors due to excessive API polling conflicting with backend rate limiting.

### Root Causes:
1. **Aggressive Frontend Polling**: Multiple components polling every 2-30 seconds
2. **Conservative Backend Rate Limiting**: Only 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
3. **No Error Handling**: Polling continued even after rate limit errors

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Increased Backend Rate Limits**
- **Before**: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- **After**: 2000 requests per 15 minutes
- **Health checks**: Excluded from rate limiting

### 2. **Optimized Frontend Polling**
- **Main enquiries polling**: 30s → 60s
- **CRM stats polling**: 30s → 60s  
- **Module polling**: 2s → 10s
- **Reports polling**: 5s → 15s

### 3. **Smart Error Handling**
- **429 detection**: Stops polling on rate limit errors
- **Auto-resume**: Resumes polling after 5 minutes
- **Error logging**: Better visibility into rate limiting issues

## 📊 Polling Frequency Changes

| Component | Before | After | Reduction |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Main Enquiries | 30s | 60s | 50% |
| CRM Stats | 30s | 60s | 50% |
| Work Done | 2s | 10s | 80% |
| Billing | 2s | 10s | 80% |
| Completed | 2s | 10s | 80% |
| Pickup | 2s | 10s | 80% |
| Service | 2s | 10s | 80% |
| Delivery | 2s | 10s | 80% |
| Reports | 5s | 15s | 67% |

## 🔧 Files Modified

### Backend Changes
- `backend/src/app.ts` - Increased rate limits, added health check exclusion
- `backend/env.example` - Updated default rate limit values

### Frontend Changes
- `src/services/enquiryApiService.ts` - Smart polling with error handling
- `src/components/crm/CRMModule.tsx` - Increased polling interval
- `src/components/work-done/WorkDoneModule.tsx` - Reduced polling frequency
- `src/components/billing/BillingModule.tsx` - Reduced polling frequency
- `src/components/completed/CompletedModule.tsx` - Reduced polling frequency
- `src/components/pickup/PickupModule.tsx` - Reduced polling frequency
- `src/components/service/ServiceModule.tsx` - Reduced polling frequency
- `src/components/delivery/DeliveryModule.tsx` - Reduced polling frequency
- `src/components/service/ServiceTypeDetail.tsx` - Reduced polling frequency
- `src/components/reports/ReportsModule.tsx` - Reduced polling frequency

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

1. **Commit and push** the changes to your repository
2. **Redeploy** on Render (should happen automatically)
3. **Monitor logs** for any remaining rate limit issues
4. **Test the application** to ensure polling still works effectively

## 📈 Expected Results

- **No more 429 errors** on Render
- **Reduced server load** from excessive polling
- **Better user experience** with smart error handling
- **Maintained real-time updates** with optimized intervals

## 🔍 Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- Render logs for any remaining rate limit messages
- Application performance and responsiveness
- User feedback on data freshness

## 🛠️ Further Optimization (Optional)

If you still experience issues, consider:

1. **WebSocket implementation** for real-time updates
2. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for push notifications
3. **Manual refresh buttons** instead of automatic polling
4. **Conditional polling** based on user activity

## 📞 Support

If issues persist after these changes:
1. Check Render logs for specific error patterns
2. Monitor the `/health` endpoint for server status
3. Consider upgrading to a paid Render plan for better performance
